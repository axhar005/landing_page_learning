# Sketchpad Etch-A-Sketch Project

Welcome to the Sketchpad Etch-A-Sketch project! This project is designed to flex your DOM manipulation skills by creating a fun and interactive browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

## Introduction

In this project, you'll be building a neat toy to enhance your DOM manipulation skills. You'll create a browser-based sketchpad with a grid of squares that change color when your mouse passes over them. This project will challenge you to use the JavaScript methods and CSS properties you've learned so far.

## Assignment

### Features

- A 16x16 grid of square divs created using JavaScript.
- Grid squares arranged using Flexbox.
- Hover effect that changes the color of the grid squares.
- A button that prompts the user to enter a new grid size, then generates a new grid accordingly.
- Color picker to choose different pen colors.

## How It Works

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Set Up the Grid:**
   - Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
   - Use JavaScript to create the divs instead of manually adding them to your HTML file.
   - Place the grid squares inside a “container” div.
   - Use Flexbox to arrange the squares in a grid.

2. **Hover Effect:**
   - Set up a hover effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them.

3. **Grid Size Button:**
   - Add a button that prompts the user to enter the number of squares per side for a new grid.
   - Remove the existing grid and generate a new one based on the user's input.
